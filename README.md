# Luminaphone

*More details coming soon*

The Luminaphone was an odd electronic musical instrument created 100 years ago. Only one prototype was ever built, and no recordings of its music have survived. I have reconstructed this unusual instrument to see what it sounded like.

The Luminaphone has a really interesting history. It was invented by a man named Harry Grindell Matthews.

He invented a lot of other things as well, like a wireless remote control system for submarines and a self-righting flying machine, but he is best known for a dubious claim he made about creating what he called a Death Ray. It was supposed to instantly and silently kill, and bring motors to a halt. He claimed it would end wars forever.

All of this created quite the international stir, but he was never able to back up those claims with a demonstration, and so he lost the people’s trust. A NYT article from the time about the Luminaphone derisively called him Death Ray Man.

The Luminaphone, on the other hand, was definitely real. People who heard it described it as sounding something like a little pipe organ.

## How It Works

This is what Matthews’ Luminaphone circuit looked like. Each key turned on an incandescent bulb that was directed at a particular ring in ta metal disc, which was spinning at 400 RPMs. Each ring had a pattern of holes made in it. Light that made it through the holes in the disc fell on a selenium cell (an early photoresistor), which altered the amount of current that flowed through it, and the transformer it was in series with. This transformer removed any DC components from the signal, leaving just the light modulated signal on the other side of the transformer. This was fed into some amplifiers before it reached a speaker.
