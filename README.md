# Luminaphone

*More details coming soon*

The Luminaphone was an odd electronic musical instrument created 100 years ago. Only one prototype was ever built, and no recordings of its music have survived. I have reconstructed this unusual instrument to see what it sounded like.

The Luminaphone has a really interesting history. It was invented by a man named Harry Grindell Matthews.

He invented a lot of other things as well, like a wireless remote control system for submarines and a self-righting flying machine, but he is best known for a dubious claim he made about creating what he called a Death Ray. It was supposed to instantly and silently kill, and bring motors to a halt. He claimed it would end wars forever.

All of this created quite the international stir, but he was never able to back up those claims with a demonstration, and so he lost the peopleâ€™s trust. A NYT article from the time about the Luminaphone derisively called him Death Ray Man.

The Luminaphone, on the other hand, was definitely real. People who heard it described it as sounding something like a little pipe organ. The instrument consisted of a spinning metal disc with rings of holes in it. Each ring could be illuminated by a separate light bulb when a key on a keyboard was pressed. That allowed light through, but only when holes passed by the light. That light fell on a selenium cell, which was an early photoresistor This turned the pulses of light into pulses of electrical current, which were passed through amplifiers before being fed into a speaker.
